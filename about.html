<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'd like to think of myself as a very logical person and love to solve problems which is why I have decided to persue a more technical field to master as I have graduated from University.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I have always taken a logical approach to everything that falls in my path and I am fortunate enough to be able to study coding full-time towards becoming a software developer.</p>
<p>I am very dedicated to learning  as I am very ambitious and have access to people who are already senior software developers and higher.</p>
